Reliable calibration remains a major challenge in near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, especially under low-data 
conditions or across instruments with varying configurations. To address this, we propose PLSELM, a lightweight 
modeling calibration method, which combines Partial Least Squares (PLS) score matrices and Ensemble Extreme 
Learning Machine (ELM). By modeling the relationship between latent PLS features and concentration values, 
PLSELM provides a fast, robust, and transferable calibration framework.
